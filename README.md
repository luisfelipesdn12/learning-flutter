In this one, I've followed the [Flutter Get Started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started) guide, adn then added my own functionalities, like decrease and reset. Just so I can learn how everything works.

To know how to use multiple floating action buttons, I've used [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56755121/12534588).

## [dicee-flutter](./dicee-flutter)

An app that genarates random numbers by clicking on dices.

Based on the 7th section of the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart).

I've made some improvements to the original app, and the main things I've used are:

- Create a custom widget for the dices.
- Use the `Random` class to generate random numbers.
- Replace the deprecated `FlatButton` widget with `TextButton`.
- Learn how to use the `Expanded` widget.

I've created an external util function that generates a natural and non-repeted random number between.
