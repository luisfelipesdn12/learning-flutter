In this one, I've followed the [Flutter Get Started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started) guide, adn then added my own functionalities, like decrease and reset. Just so I can learn how everything works.

To know how to use multiple floating action buttons, I've used [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56755121/12534588).

I've made some improvements to the original app, and the main things I've used are:
