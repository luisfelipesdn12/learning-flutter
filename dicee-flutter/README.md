# dicee-flutter

An app that genarates random numbers by clicking on dices.

Based on the 7th section of the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart).

I've made some improvements to the original app, and the main things I've used are:

- Create a custom widget for the dices.
- Use the `Random` class to generate random numbers.
- Replace the deprecated `FlatButton` widget with `TextButton`.
- Learn how to use the `Expanded` widget.
